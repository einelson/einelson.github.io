                <p id=paragraph>The image colorization project was based around seeing if you could predict the colored counterpart of a greyscale image.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>The model was based off of learning on a broad set of images and the goal was to predict image with any amalgam of colors.</a>.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>The model built was not complex enough or trained enough to predict colorful images well and this particular model loves to predict reds, blues and oranges.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>In order to fine tune this in the future I would make the image prediction less generic and be used to predict only like-images: images that come from the same source and have the same final format..</p>

                <h2 id=title>Use Cases</h2>
                <p id=paragraph>Why use image colorization, why not just use colored images?</p>
                <p id=paragraph>Everything takes up some sort of space. Images are generally made up of 3 channels consisting of R(red), G(green), B(blue). When sending or storing data you need to save the 3 channels that the image consists of.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>Lets say you want to send or store a large image in an enviroment where there is restrictions in space, or speed in sending the image. By converting the image from RGB to a L(perceptual lightness) A(red, green) B(blue, yellow) colorscale and only using the L channel you are effectivley saving 3x the space. The L channel is considered greyscale ond only takes up one channel.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>Using image colorization we recreate the exact image when it is needed. While the algorithm I built as an example for this is not close to production worthy it is a working example of how this is an achievable goal.</p>
