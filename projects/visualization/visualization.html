        <p id=paragraph>These are all of my data visualizations! I love trying new visualizations and these are some that I have worked on.</p>


        <!-- Causation graph -->
        <div class="row" id=row>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h2 id=title>Event/ Causation Graph</h2>
                <p id=paragraph>Causation is not correlation. This is the first thing I learned when diving into data. Just because your data rises and falls at the same time does not mean that one causes the other to change. I wanted to build a time series-event based graph to help determine what causes change.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>This graph is designed with a time-series graph running along the bottom x-axis. Along the top x-axis runs a timeline which matches the time data value of the bottom x-axis.</p>
                <!-- <p id=paragraph>I apologize that the quality is not great and that this is not a computer generated graph. What is important is what we learn from this.</p> -->
                <p id=paragraph>While you could say that these graphs correlate, when you see the events surrounding both companies you see that different events are causing the change in value.</p>

                <p id=paragraph>How much did Coca-Cola make between the years 2008-2018? How much employees did they have and how have their stocks grown? This was just a fun project I did to visualize that.</p>

                <p id=paragraph>This visualization was to help me understand how I spend time on my phone. Data was gathered over a 1 week period by day to see which day of the week I spend on my phone the most. I wanted to mostly see how much time I spent on social media so I can cut back from that.</p>

                <h2 id=title>Set comparison</h2>
                <p id=paragraph>I was working on a project in python that involved comparing sets of documents pulled from a mongo db. After comparing many sets I realized that the comparison was taking longer and longer. 
                    I decided to gather data and make a graph to visualize the comparison time. From the graph you can see in the best case scenario the comparison time is O(n). I assume the outliers were caused by pythons GIL or possibly out of order set.
