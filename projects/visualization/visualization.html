                <p id=paragraph>This visualization was to help me understand how I spend time on my phone. Data was gathered over a 1 week period by day to see which day of the week I spend on my phone the most. I wanted to mostly see how much time I spent on social media so I can cut back from that.</p>

                <h2 id=title>Set comparison</h2>
                <p id=paragraph>I was working on a project in python that involved comparing sets of documents pulled from a mongo db. After comparing many sets I realized that the comparison was taking longer and longer. 
                    I decided to gather data and make a graph to visualize the comparison time. From the graph you can see in the best case scenario the comparison time is O(n). I assume the outliers were caused by pythons GIL or possibly out of order set.
