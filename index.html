        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Ethan Nelson. I am currently studying computer science at Brigham Young University-Idaho.<br>
            I have always been interested in technology. At age 14, I built my first version of a “robot” which
             ended up being a spinning top, followed up by a bot that can detect the edges of tables and steer 
             away. When I was 15, I won the grand prize in an international youth design competition hosted by 
             Instructables.com. This helped me learn how to follow sets of rules, think outside the box as well 
             as learn how to follow a time limit. In addition to those things, I am eager to learn and apply new 
             skills. In 2018, I bought a car that needed extensive repairs. I had no prior experience with cars, 
             but within 8 months, I had successfully replaced the engine, transmission, and suspension. The 
             experiences I gained in working with robots as well as repairing my car prepared me to face new 
             situations and challenges with confidence that I will learn and be able to produce effective 
             solutions.  My passion is to learn and apply programming skills to benefit people around me. 
             A recent project I worked on was to use Machine Learning through Keras Tensorflow and Neural 
             Networks to take a black and white photo and predict the colored counterpart. All of these 
             experiences have helped me kindle my passion of design and creation.<br>
