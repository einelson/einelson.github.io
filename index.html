                <p id=paragraph>I love to work on and fix cars. At the age of 22 I restored and sold my dream car- a 66 mustang. I am now working on restoring a 67 mustang as my dream cara again as I had to sell the 66.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>While in college I worked as a carpenter and started to make and sell custom furniture on the side. Making furniture in a 1 car garage is not easy!</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I love the outdoors. I love camping, hiking and being in the mountains. When camping we would tie our hammocks between a tree and the bumper of my jeep.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I love to weld. I learned as a senior in high school and while in college I was contracted to help weld shark tanks for an aquarium.</p>
