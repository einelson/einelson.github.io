                <p id=paragraph>Hey guys! I am currently a software engineer over in Virginia. I enjoy working on machine learning problems and data visualization.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I really just enjoy working on any problems. I would like to think I am a good problem solver, and not just with software. I think that everything we know and have learned can pool over into other areas of our life.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I hope that whatever I do is something that can benefit and help people. There is so much good that can be shared with others.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>Keep reading and get to know more about me! and if you want help on any projects don't hesitate to reach out to me!</p>

                <p id=paragraph>I went to school at Brigham Young University Idaho (2018-2021) and graduated with a degree in computer science.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>My favorite classes were the machine learning and senior project classes.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>While I do not currently do machine learning or data visualization for work I continue to work on it in my free time.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>Continuing education is important to me. I am always learning new software and discovering new ways to do things!</p>

                <p id=paragraph>I love to work on and fix cars. At the age of 22 I restored and sold my dream car- a 66 mustang.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>While in college I worked as a carpenter and started to make and sell custom furniture on the side. Making furniture in a 1 car garage is not easy!</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I love the outdoors. I love camping, hiking and being in the mountains. When camping we would tie our hammocks between a tree and the bumper of my jeep.</p>
                <p id=paragraph>I love to weld. I learned as a senior in high school and while in college I was contracted to help weld shark tanks for an aquarium.</p>
